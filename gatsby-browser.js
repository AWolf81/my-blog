// Note: Always use dark theme as it looks also good in the light theme (temporary fix)
//       Switching prism-themes not that easy with gatsby-remark-prismjs plugin
//       --> adding a feature to the plugin would simplify this e.g. load all theme css so they're avaliable
//           for switching with styled components theme.
